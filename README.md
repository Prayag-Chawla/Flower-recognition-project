# Flower-recognition-project

So its a deep learning project where we gatheered one image data from kaggle, trained it, modelled it, compiled it, used various different atributes from torchvision,modelled it, plotted it, and finaly predicted individual images. A typical DL project where we use large media data to analyse and define and work upon various commands.
